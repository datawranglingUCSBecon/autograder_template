\subsection{Welcome}\label{welcome}}

Welcome to \textbf{Data Wrangling for Economics}! This course will focus
on students learning the basics of data cleaning and manipulation
through the statistical software R. All homework and exams will have a
coding component. To grade this, the class is utilizing a software
called \textbf{Gradescope}. This software allows universities to
automatically grade assignments including code. In this class, students
will submit both their code and a brief writeup simulating real world
data analysis. This manual will focus on the code aspect of their
submissions.

Students will upload their code to Gradescope which will grade it. In
order for Gradescope to do this, the instructor must supply an
\textbf{autograder} for each assignment. An autograder is a script that
reads scripts and assigns a score to the accuracy. This tutorial is
meant to teach the reader how to write a Gradescope autograder in R.

Working with Gradescope's autograder function requires a great deal of
computer knowledge beyond that of a normal social science graduate
student. To alleviate this burden, a great deal of infrastructure has
been built. This infrastructure automates a lot of the technical issues
saving both time and hair.

After reading through the manual, you should:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Know what R and Rstudio is as well as how to download both programs.
\item
  Know how to log into Github, clone repositories to your computer, pull
  the repository to your computer, and upload.
\item
  Know what Gradescope is, how to log in, and upload autograders.
\item
  Know the components of an autograder.
\item
  Be able to write your own autograder.
\item
  Upload the autograder to Gradescope through Github.
\item
  Confidently debug your autograder.
\end{enumerate}

This manual is written for incoming TAs. It is assumed the
infrastructure for the class is already in place. If you are building
the course from scratch, see the \emph{Building Infrastructure} section
at the very end of the manual.

The flexibility of the infrastructure discussed allows for usage beyond
\textbf{Data Wrangling in R}. While the target audience is the incoming
TAs, the manual and infrastructure have uses for all individuals
interested in assigning coding homework in R. Other resources exists for
C++, Python and R. Please see the
\href{https://gradescope-autograders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources/}{community
resource boards}.

This is a working draft of the manual. Please do not distribute. Please
do not share this manual with current or potential students of
\textbf{Data Wrangling in R}.

\hypertarget{setup}{%
\section{Setup}\label{setup}}

This section reviews the necessary programs and getting started.

\hypertarget{r-and-rstudio}{%
\subsection{R and RStudio}\label{r-and-rstudio}}

R is a powerful statistical software used for data analysis. R can be
downloaded \href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{here}. Pick the
appropriate version for your device.

Rstudio is a ``skin'' for R. This allows the user to script, create
latex documents integrated to code, and much much more! The program can
be downloaded
\href{https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}{here}. Pick the
free desktop version.

\hypertarget{rprojects}{%
\subsubsection{RProjects}\label{rprojects}}

R projects create environments within R. These environments include
files (Rfiles, datasets, etc.) as well as saved settings. This is
extremely useful for integration with Github. You'll notice you are in a
project when the R banner has a logo around it:

\begin{center}
\frame{\includegraphics[width=5in]{pictures/rproject.png} }
\end{center}

Creating projects will be discussed in the Github section.

\hypertarget{github}{%
\subsection{Github}\label{github}}

Github is an online code sharing platform. It allows for collaboration
among many individuals on the same piece of code, saving past version.
All autograders for this course will be uploaded to Github. This is done
for two reasons: (i) reproducibility of the course and (ii) efficiency
in debugging.

We will be working in a shared repository from individual accounts.
Think of this as a shared folder in Google Drive: we can all edit,
upload, and download in real time.

At the end of this document, you should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  log into Github
\item
  create a clone of the repository on your computer
\item
  be familiar with the main github commands
\item
  upload and download from Github using RStudio
\end{itemize}

This is not an exhaustive manual. It is an introduction to Github with
RStudio.

\hypertarget{getting-started}{%
\subsubsection{Getting Started}\label{getting-started}}

First, you will have to create a Github. Simply log onto
\href{https://github.com/}{github.com} and sign up. It's free! After
creating a Github, you will be invited to the Github repository. Accept
the invitation. The repository will look something like this:

\begin{center}
\frame{\includegraphics[width=5in]{pictures/github1.PNG} }
\end{center}

Click \texttt{clone\ or\ download} (the green button) then copy the
\emph{password protected SSH key} (where the green arrow is pointing).

\begin{center}
\frame{\includegraphics[width=5in]{pictures_github/github_copy.PNG} }
\end{center}

In order to make working with Github as easy as possible, the TA will
clone the repository to their home computer. This way they can do all
their edits natively and then upload back to Github for everyone to use.
If you are working with a PC, you will need to download
\href{https://gitforwindows.org}{GitBash}. Mac computers have GitBash
integrated into their terminal.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Next, open RStudio. Go to \texttt{File} and choose
  \texttt{New\ Project}.
\item
  Choose \texttt{Version\ Control}.
\item
  Click \texttt{Git}.
\item
  paste the \emph{password protected SSH key} into
  \texttt{Repository\ URL}. Name the project whatever you want and save
  it wherever you want.
\end{itemize}

Congrats! Now you have the Github repository saved onto your computer.
Everything you do on your computer can be synced with the Github
repository and everything on the repository can be synced with your
computer! The next section will go through how that works.

\hypertarget{the-basics-of-git-and-github}{%
\subsubsection{The Basics of Git and
Github}\label{the-basics-of-git-and-github}}

Many, many, many sources exist providing tutorials on using Github
(e.g.~\href{https://happygitwithr.com}{here},
\href{http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html}{here} and
\href{https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-git-and-github-6fcd0f2d4ac6}{this
one}). This manual will focus on the Github steps relevant to the
course. Please read through at least the first two links.

When we run into conflicts, check out this
\href{https://medium.com/@RedRoxProjects/how-do-i-git-three-ways-to-solve-a-merge-conflict-cde4d7924c80}{link}.

The big ideas you need to take away from the links are:
\texttt{git\ pull}, \texttt{git\ add}, \texttt{git\ commit},
\texttt{git\ push}, and \texttt{version\ control}.

\hypertarget{the-git-pane}{%
\subsubsection{The Git pane}\label{the-git-pane}}

The Git pane is a GUI interface for Git. Below is a picture of the pane
with some key features highlighted:

\begin{center}
\frame{\includegraphics[width=5in]{pictures_github/github_pane.PNG} }
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Staged (pink arrow): Click the box to \texttt{git\ add}.
\item
  Commit (pink box): This is equivalent to \texttt{git\ commit}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Pro Tip: \texttt{git\ commit} comments should be short. Each
commit should be one task. Examples of this would be writing a line in a
manual, or writing one answer for an autograder. This makes it easier to
retrace steps in the future.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Blue arrow: \texttt{git\ pull}. Always do this before doing anything.
  \texttt{git\ pull} syncs the files on your computer with that in
  Github.
\item
  green arrow: \texttt{git\ push}. This syncs Github with your changes
  on your computer.
\end{itemize}

\texttt{git\ add} stages your changes, \texttt{git\ commit} allows you
to comment the changes, \texttt{git\ push} sends your changes to Github,
and \texttt{git\ pull} pulls all changes to Github to your computer.

\textbf{Pro-tip: A git commit should equate to one task. Each git commit
should be summarized in a sentence or less. This means that you will be
constantly git committing and pushing to Github.}

\hypertarget{version-control}{%
\subsubsection{Version Control}\label{version-control}}

Version control is used to ensure individuals don't ``bump'' into each
other. With many people editing the same documents, sometimes changes
are incompatible with merging. Imagine you and another colleague both
edit the same line of code. Luckily, Github is perfectly equipped to
handle these issues. This idea will be revisited in the \textbf{Version
Control} section.

To end this section, I will state a few Git commandments I've made up or
found:

\[\text{Github Commandment 1: Push and Pull often}\] If you think you
are pushing or pulling too much, you're not. People will be making
changes constantly and this will lead to issues if everyone isn't on the
same page.

\[\text{Github Commandment 2: Never, Ever, Ever, EVER git push --force}\]
This overrides any merge conflict. That means you are saying that your
stuff should override everything. Don't do that. If there's a conflict,
talk with your team and figure out what's the best course of action.

\hypertarget{gradescope}{%
\subsection{Gradescope}\label{gradescope}}

\hypertarget{intro}{%
\subsubsection{Intro}\label{intro}}

Gradescope is a \(3^{rd}\) party software designed to make grading
faster and easier. Gradescope allows for all types of assignments to be
graded. This class will focus on using Gradescope to grade student
written assignments and code. We will be utilizing Gradescope's
autograder functions. Before delving into the autograder, this section
will walk the reader through the basic navigation of Gradescope. For the
purposes of the manual, we will be working in the course ``Practice''.
This section will explain:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  How to find and log into Gradescope.
\item
  How to navigate to assignments.
\item
  How to setup new assignments.
\item
  Where to enter in the autograder.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{navigating-gradescope}{%
\subsubsection{Navigating Gradescope}\label{navigating-gradescope}}

To begin, simply type in
\href{https://www.gradescope.com/}{www.gradescope.com}. If the user is
not already logged in, they will be greeted with the following image:

\begin{center}
\frame{\includegraphics[width=5in]{pictures/gradescopeintro.png} }
\end{center}

Click the ``log In'' button in the top right hand corner. You will be
redirected to a login screen. Click \textbf{School Credentials} and
select UCSB. From there, you will log in using your \textbf{UCSB} login
information. The page will then direct you here. Please click the
relevant course (in our example, it is \textbf{Practice}):

\begin{center}
\frame{\includegraphics[width=5in]{pictures/gradescopeintro2.png} }
\end{center}

\hypertarget{making-a-new-assignment}{%
\paragraph{Making a New Assignment}\label{making-a-new-assignment}}

Gradescope assignments are created using the button in the bottom right
hand corner:

\begin{center}
\frame{\includegraphics[width=5in]{pictures/gradescopeinto3.png} }
\end{center}

A popup box will ask what type of assignment is being created. Select
\textbf{\textless/\textgreater{} Programming Assignment}, then click
next.

Next, a popup creating the assignment setting will appear. Please fill
in the setting appropriately. This will be provided to you by the head
TA in the form of a rubric or via conversation. If you do not know the
setting, \textbf{ASK A FELLOW TA OR INSTRUCTOR}. The example image has
been filled in for illustrative purposes:

\begin{center}
\frame{\includegraphics[width=5in]{pictures/gradescopeintro4.png} }
\end{center}

Gradescope will then automatically open to the outline section. Notice
that the autograder points are already in the top right hand corner. Add
a new question titled ``style'' and set the point value to 0. This
allows the grader to allocate points for ``clean code''. By setting it
equal to 0, we are saying we don't care about the cleanliness of the
code. In the future, this may become part of the rubric, but for now
leave it as 0. Then click ``save outline''.

\begin{center}
\frame{\includegraphics[width=5in]{pictures/gradescopeintro5.png} }
\end{center}

Finally, we are at the upload autograder phase! This is where the reader
will submit the autograder. What an autograder is and the components of
an autograder are discussed in details in the following chapters. For
the time being, just know the autograder comprises a zip file called
``Autograder.zip'' and an R file on Github. Click the ``select
Autograder.zip'' file and upload your created autograder.

\begin{center}
\frame{\includegraphics[width=5in]{pictures/gradescopeintro6.png} }
\end{center}

This concludes the section on Gradescope. At the end of this section,
the reader should know:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  How to find and log into gradescope.
\item
  How to navigate to assignments.
\item
  How to setup new assignments.
\item
  Where to enter in the autograder.zip. The reader does not yet know
  what constitutes the autograder.zip.
\end{enumerate}

The following section will delve into the parts of the autograder and
how to actually make one.

\hypertarget{how-to-use-this}{%
\section{How to Use this}\label{how-to-use-this}}

\hypertarget{the-autograder}{%
\section{The Autograder}\label{the-autograder}}

An in depth review of autograders is provided on the gradescope
\href{https://gradescope-autograders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{website}.
This section will review the main features and what is directly
applicable to this course.

\hypertarget{parts-of-the-autograder}{%
\subsection{Parts of the Autograder}\label{parts-of-the-autograder}}

The Autograder is composed of multiple files. The files that go directly
into gradescope are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{setup.sh}: installs all dependencies into Gradescope. This
  means the necessary packages, R, and the github codes. The file is a
  shell script. To open the setup file, right click on it and select
  ``open with TextEdit'' (``Notepad'' for PC). You will simply copy this
  file over. \textbf{No editing needs to happen in this file!!} Just
  copy and paste. That said, the file looks like this:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}
\frame{\includegraphics[width=5in]{pictures/setup1.png} }
\end{center}

The first line is saying that it's a bash file. The following 5
non-blank lines are downloading Linux and R. The following group of
lines (Rscript -e) are installing the necessary Rpackages for the
homework. Make sure you set dependenceis to \textbf{TRUE}. Otherwise,
Gradescope will (probably) time out.

On a very technical note, Gradescope autograders run on Ubuntu 18.04
virtual machine. The default version of R downloaded on the machine is
\textbf{R 3.4.4}. If you need a different version of R, you must specify
specific lines in the setup.sh file. The code provided above (feor
\textbf{setup.sh}) installs R 3.6.3.

Notice the line follows a pattern: \textbf{Rscript -e
``install.packages(`PACKAGE\_NAME', dependencies=TRUE)''} where
PACKAGE\_NAME is the name of a package used in the software.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{run\_autograder}: runs and compiles the autograder suite and
  produces the output in the correct place. run\_autograder is a .txt
  file. The file looks like this:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}
\frame{\includegraphics[width=5in]{pictures/runautograder1.png} }
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{\#!/usr/bin/env bash}: establishing this is a bash file
\item
  \textbf{\# move student submissions to appropriate locations on remote
  server}: Describing what the file is doing. This is not run.
\item
  \textbf{cp /autograder/submission/test.R /autograder/source/test.R}:
  copies the student's submission from the autograder submission file to
  the source file. The source file is where your autograder will live
  along with \emph{setup.sh} and \emph{run\_autograder}. You will have
  to change \emph{test.R} to the name of the student's file name.
\item
  \textbf{cd /autograder/source}: copies the source directory. DO NOT
  TOUCH THIS.
\item
  \textbf{git clone
  \url{https://GITHUBUSERNAME:GITHUBPASSWORD@github.com/datawranglingUCSBecon/autograder}}:
  This will clone the github repository. Each time the autograder is run
  it will reclone the repository. This allows for little changes to be
  made to the code.
\item
  \textbf{\#Loading the preset functions. DO NOT CHANGE.}: A comment for
  those reading the code.
\item
  \textbf{cp autograderecon/helperfunctions/JSONmaker.R
  /autograder/source/JSONmaker.R}: Copies the helper function
  \emph{JSONmaker.R} into the source folder.
\item
  \textbf{cp autograderecon/helperfunctions/setup.R
  /autograder/source/setup.R}: Copies the helper function \emph{setup.R}
  into the source folder.
\item
  \textbf{cp autograderecon/helperfunctions/packages.R
  /autograder/source/packages.R}: Copies the helper function
  \emph{packages.R} into the source folder.
\item
  \textbf{cp autograderecon/Template/autograder\_setup.R}

  \textbf{/autograder/source/autograder\_setup.R}: Copies the helper
  function \emph{autograder\_setup.R} into the source folder.
\item
  \textbf{\# Grab the Data generating process.}: A comment.
\item
  \textbf{cp autograderecon/Template/DGP.R /autograder/source/DGP.R}:
  Copies the unique student data generating process into the source
  folder.
\item
  \textbf{\# Grab the autograder you wrote.}: A comment.
\item
  \textbf{cp autograderecon/Template/inputs\_template.R}

  \textbf{/autograder/source/inputs\_template.R}: Copies the inputs into
  the source folder.
\item
  \textbf{\# Grab master datafile.}: A comment.
\item
  \textbf{cp autograderecon/Template/MasterData.csv
  /autograder/source/MasterData.csv}: Copies the master datafile into
  the source folder.
\item
  \textbf{Rscript autograder/Practice/autograde\_test.R}: This runs the
  home-made autograder. You will change Practice to the name of the
  folder you are working in and autograde\_test.R to the name of the
  Rscript you wrote. Make sure \emph{autograde\_test.R} matches the
  \emph{autograde\_test.R} which matches the name of your Rscript!
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  \textbf{autograder\_setup.R}: An R function that references the other
  helper functions. This will never need to be edited
\item
  \textbf{inputs\_template.R}: The pre-requisites necessary for the
  homework assignment. This is set to the specific homework assignment
\end{enumerate}

  students answers. The hard part will be trying to account for how each
  student can mess up the answer! A general layout of the autograder is

\item
  2: clears environment
\item
  5: Set whether you are working locally (aka your own computer) or
  sending to \emph{Gradescope}. Forgetting to change this to
  \emph{Gradescope} will be the number one reason why Gradescope will
  break.
\item
  11-12: Source two R files. This function was created to automatically
  grade issues such as mislabeled R-files, data, or other generally
  weird things that could occur. \emph{autograder\_setup} will check the
  student:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Called the function by the right name.
  \item
    Called the data by the right name.
  \item
    Included their PERMID
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

It then returns:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A dataframe called \emph{test.results} that the TA will fill in with
  the student's score. This dataframe is a ``parts'' (line 22) x 4
  dataframe. The \emph{test.results} dataframe looks something like this
  when ``parts''=2:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
##   name score maxscore output
## 1   NA    NA       NA     NA
## 2   NA    NA       NA     NA
\end{verbatim}

All the TA has to do is fill in the name of the part (e.g.~``Problem 1
(10 pt.)'' ), the score the student received, the maximum possible score
for that part, and any comment they'd like the student to see. Columns 1
and 3 will be some pre-determined value while columns 2 and 4 will be
student dependent. This means there must be scripts that account for all
possible answers (in theory).

The creation of this table may seem a bit confusing. The reason for the
table creation and fill-in method is Gradescope requires a specifically
formatted JSON\footnote{JSON is a way to store data. No need to know
  anything else because of the fill-in-the-table approach!} file in
order to grade the students' work. To try and simplify the process, a
helper function was written to convert a table to a JSON file. In order
for the helper function to create the JSON file, it requires a
pre-formatted dataframe.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  18-27: Where the TA will fill in test.results. This is where all the
  magic happens. This is where the code is correctly run by the TA and
  then compared to the student's answers. The main takeaway here is that
  each line of test.results must follow the same pattern:
\end{itemize}

\[\text{c("Name", "Student Score", "Max Score", "Comments")}\] The
student score does not have to be filled in-line. The example above was
a very simple grading scheme so that it could be put in-line. In later
examples, I show more complex problems where the grader is done
out-of-line.

How the table gets filled in is entirely up to the TA. The key is that
the table is completed in that order. JSONmaker will report errors if
the table does not match this specification.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  27: A helper function that exports the test.results in the proper
  format for Gradescope to read. For those technically inclined, more
  information can be found

\subsection{A Fully Worked Out

Here is an example homework assignment:

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\[\text{Problem Set Example}\]

Hello student with PERMID 1234,

Welcome to practice assignment 1. You have been given a dataset with
1000 observations and 4 columns titled: \emph{Names}, \emph{State},
\emph{Invoice\ldots USD\ldots{}}, and \emph{Paid}. You have been asked
to do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Save your Rfilename as \emph{test.R}.
\item
  Locally read in your data file \emph{fakedata.csv} and save it as
  \emph{fakedata}.
\item
  Save your PERMID number as PERMID (e.g.~PERMID \textless- \#\#\#\#\#)
\item
  Report how many invoices came from Kansas. Save this as
  \emph{invoice.kansas} (yes, capitals matter)
\item
  Report how many individuals have paid their invoices. Save this as
  \emph{P1}.
\end{enumerate}

Upload your R code to Gradescope.

\textbf{ALL CHANGES TO THE DATA MUST BE DONE WITHIN THE RSCRIPT
SUBMITTED.}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

We will write an autograder for this problem set. Below are the steps:

\hypertarget{git-pull}{%
\subsubsection{Git pull}\label{git-pull}}

First, you must make sure your native repository is up to date. Many
people will be updating the Github at once. Open the RProject and press
the blue arrow.

This will update your github status.

\hypertarget{enter-the-autograderecon-folder}{%
\subsubsection{Enter the Autograderecon
Folder}\label{enter-the-autograderecon-folder}}

This folder is the folder that was downloaded from Github earlier in the
manual. You should see many folders including a \emph{template} folder.
You should also see a folder with the same name as your assignment. In
this case, it is \emph{PSExample}. Copy the contents in the template
folder into the PSExample folder. Rename \emph{autograder\_template.R}
to \emph{autograder\_\{name of assignment\}.R} and
\emph{inputs\_template.R} to \emph{inputs\_\{name of assignment\}.R}. In
this case, it would be \emph{autograder\_PSExample.R} and
\emph{inputs\_PSExample.R}. The \emph{PSExample} folder should now
include:

\begin{center}
\frame{\includegraphics[width=5in]{pictures/exampl1.png} }
\end{center}

Now would be a good time to git commit and push your work.

Notice that a master dataset was already in your folder. There are now
seven files in your folder: (i) masterdata.csv, (ii) run\_autograder,
(iii) setup.sh, (iv) autograde\_PSExample.r, (v) autograder\_setup.R,
(vi) DGP.R and (vii) inputs\_PSExample.R. You copied in all but (i).
Notice you only have to copy these three files in if they are not
already there.

\textbf{Pro Tip: Sometimes, the prompt and rubric will also be in the
folder. Do not be alarmed if the prompt and rubric are in your folder.}

Now, we have to change the location in \emph{run\_autograder}. To do
this, right click on \emph{run\_autograder} and open it with a text
tool. On Macs, use TextEdit. To open TextEdit, right click on
\emph{run\_autograder} and then click \textbf{open with} and click
\textbf{other}. Once open, you should see the following:

\begin{center}
\frame{\includegraphics[width=5in]{pictures/exampl2.png} }
\end{center}

You will have to change the highlighted squares to the proper name. The
highlighted squares (by color) should be:

green: The name the students are supposed to call their file. In the
example, they are asked to call it ``test.R''.

purple: The name of the folder you are working in. In this case, it is
PSExample. Change the name to ``PSExample''.

yellow: The name of the data generating process in the folder you are
working in. In this case, it is ``DGP.R''.

blue: The name of the input template. In this case, it is called
``inputs\_PSExample.R''.

red: The name of your autograder file. In this case, you were asked to
name the autograder file ``autograder\_PSExample.R''. Change
``autograde\_test.R'' to ``autograder\_PSExample.R''.

We are now done with the \emph{run\_autograder}. Save, commit, and push
it. then return to the folder. In this example, it is \emph{PSExample}.

Now enter \emph{inputs\_PSExample.R} Set the values according to the
specifications:

\hypertarget{numCode}{%
\label{numCode}}%
\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[numbers=left,,]
\CommentTok{# user inputs: CHANGE THESE TO MATCH THE ASSIGNMENT}
\NormalTok{rScript   <-}\StringTok{ "test.R"} \CommentTok{# The name the student is supposed to give the file}
\NormalTok{data      <-}\StringTok{ "fakedata.csv"} \CommentTok{#Name of the CSV file}
\NormalTok{datatitle <-}\StringTok{ "fakedata"} \CommentTok{#What the student is supposed to call the datasource}
\NormalTok{parts     <-}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{2} \CommentTok{# Number of problems being graded}
\NormalTok{Master    <-}\StringTok{ "Masterdata.csv"} \CommentTok{#The name of the master data file. This should be in folder}
\NormalTok{DGP       <-}\StringTok{ "DGP.R"} \CommentTok{# The data generating process for individual student's datasets. }
                     \CommentTok{#The filename "DGP" should have one function titled "DGP".}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now, enter \emph{autograde\_PSExample.R}. Ensure that:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  source file is set to working directory.
\item
  loc is set to ``local''.
\item
  line 11 is changed from ``inputs\_template.R'' to
  ``inputs\_PSExample.R''.
\end{enumerate}

Run the whole R file. This will create two new datafiles:
``fakedata.csv'' and ``results.json''. ``fakedata.csv'' will be the
unique dataset based off of student's PERMID number provided in the
their submitted homework. In this case, it would be ``test.R''. If no
such file is provided, the program will return ``fakedata.csv'' that is
the same as MasterData.csv. This fakedata.csv is regenerated every time
``autograde\_PSExample.R'' is run based off of the provided PERMID in
the student's homework r file (``test.R''). Make sure to save, commit,
and push.

Create an R file that is you solving the problem as if you were in the
class. This part simply requires you to solve the homework. An example
of this may look like:

\hypertarget{numCode}{%
\label{numCode}}%
\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[numbers=left,,]

\NormalTok{PERMID <-}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{1235}

\NormalTok{fakedata <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{read.csv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"fakedata.csv"}\NormalTok{)}

\NormalTok{invoice.kansas <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{sum}\NormalTok{(fakedata}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{State}\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{"Kansas"}\NormalTok{)}

\NormalTok{P1 <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{sum}\NormalTok{(fakedata}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{Paid }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "Yes"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You will be tweaking this file many times to make sure your autograder
can handle all possible mistakes students will make.

Save, commit and push your work titled what the students will title
their homework. In this example, it is ``test.R''. We will now return to
the \emph{autograder\_PSExample.R}

\hypertarget{autograder_psexample.r}{%
\subsubsection{autograder\_PSExample.R}\label{autograder_psexample.r}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Open the \emph{autograder\_PSExample.R}.
\item
  Run lines 1 through 17 If it does not run, make sure you set the
  working directory correctly. Check your global environment. You should
  see:
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  student dataset (here it's fakedata.csv)
\item
  test.results
\item
  PERMID
\item
  Student answers.
\end{enumerate}

Of course, the autograder is simply reading your native test.R file
right now! Now is the fun part. It's time to create the grader that
grades.

The grader that grades will live here:

\hypertarget{numCode}{%
\label{numCode}}%
\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[numbers=left,,]
\CommentTok{# ----- Put the Autograder Functions Here ----- #}
    
 
    
\CommentTok{# --------------------------------------------- #}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You will write scripts that (i) get the right answers and then (ii)
compare them to the student's answers. You will then fill in the
\emph{test.results} table as specified before.

\begin{center}
*REMINDER: Each student is assigned a different dataset, so there is no "universal right answer". P1 will be different for every student. That means your autograder must be script, NOT A HARD WIRED NUMBER.*
\end{center}

You will be provided a grading rubric for each homework assignment. It
will look something like this:

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\[\text{Problem Set Example Grading Rubric}\] \emph{Problem 1}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Total number of points: 10

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If correct: 10/10. else: 0/10
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{Problem 2}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Total number of points: 10

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If correct: 10/10. else: 0/10
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

There are 101 different ways to write the autograders. One example for
this homework assignment is:

\emph{Pro tip: when naming your answers, choose a different name from
the student names. Otherwise, you'll override their answers and it won't
work :/}

\hypertarget{diagnostics}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostics}\label{diagnostics}}

There are some simple diagnostics that can be performed to check the
autograder is performing optimally. Some of these are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In your toy homework assignment (test.R in the example), name the
  outputs by the wrong name. Instead of \emph{P1}, call it \emph{p1} or
  \emph{potato} or whatever else.
\item
  Experiment with rounding. Make sure a student won't get a 0 because
  they put 10.11 instead of 10.1. This can be avoided by rounding off
  the autograder values, or using the \emph{almost.equal} command. To
  use this for part 1 with a .5 tolerance, you would write:
\end{itemize}

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{almost.equal(answer.1, invoice.kansas, tolerance=.5)}
\end{aligned}
\] The tolerance is saying that these two values are equal within .5
units.

When comparing dataframes, use the command \texttt{all.equal()}. This
command will return a true if the dataframes are identical.

Now that we have made our autograder, all that's left is uploading. Make
sure to save, commit, and push.

\hypertarget{make-the-gradescope-input}{%
\subsubsection{Make the Gradescope
Input}\label{make-the-gradescope-input}}

In order to make the Gradescope input, we have to zip the setup.sh and
run\_autograder together. To do this, simply highlight those two files
and click ``compress 2 items''.

\begin{center}
\frame{\includegraphics[width=5in]{pictures/exampl3.png} }
\end{center}

Do not make a folder then zip the folder. That will NOT work in
Gradescope. Highlight the 2 files and zip those together.

\hypertarget{uploading-to-gradescope}{%
\subsubsection{Uploading to Gradescope}\label{uploading-to-gradescope}}

Put this zip into the \emph{Select Autograder .zip} from steps in the
Gradescope section. Then click ``Update Autograder''. This will take
about 20 minutes to load. Make sure the Gradescope last update status
keeps updating.

\begin{center}
\frame{\includegraphics[width=8in]{pictures/exampl4.png} }
\end{center}

And now, we are done! You have uploaded an autograder to Gradescope. To
check that it's working, try putting your fake assignment in and see
what happens.

\hypertarget{summary-of-steps}{%
\subsubsection{Summary of steps:}\label{summary-of-steps}}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  Change autograder\_run and setup.sh to right values.
\item
  Make a dummy homework R file.
\item
  Open autograder\_WHATEVERYOUNAMEDIT.R. Fill in the user inputs.
\item
  Write the autograder scripts in the prespecified part of

\hypertarget{version-control-1}{%
\section{Version Control}\label{version-control-1}}

This section is dedicated to working in groups. Github can be an amazing
tool and an even bigger headache. The key is to maximize the benefits
and invest in aspirin.

One way to mitigate the headaches is through a formalized version
control approach. This manual recommends creating individual branches
for each task. There are many resources discussing branching. One good
place to start is
\href{https://thenewstack.io/dont-mess-with-the-master-working-with-branches-in-git-and-github/}{here}.
A graphical example of this is depicted below:

\begin{center}
\frame{\includegraphics[width=5in]{pictures/github_flow.png} }
\end{center}

Notice at the center of the web is the master branch. Each pink square
represents a different branch. Every time a new job needs to be done
(e.g.~a new homework assignment or tutorial), a new branch should be
used. By having each project on it's own branch, there will be less of a
chance of conflicts when uploading and pushing. In addition, this manual
advocates \textbf{no one should be working directly on Master}.
Actually, that should be a commandment:

\[\text{Github Commandment 3: Do Not Work Directly on Master Branch}\]
Making branches in R is extremely useful. First, make sure you are in
the Rproject. Next, click the ``create new branch'' button. It is
pointed out by the green arrow in the following picture:

\begin{center}
\frame{\includegraphics[width=5in]{pictures/branch.png} }
\end{center}

Name the branch. Notice the pink box that says \emph{danny\_testing} in
the picture above? That should now be whatever you named your branch.
You can click the name in the pink box and switch between branches with
ease. However, be aware \textbf{YOU CAN SWITCH BETWEEN BRANCHES WITH
EASE}. This means you need to be extra careful of which branch is
selected.

When your work is finished on a branch, you can post a \emph{pull
request}. This is you proposing changes to Master in which the other TAs
will review and approve. Pull requests can be made directly on Github:

\begin{center}
\frame{\includegraphics[width=5in]{pictures/pull_req.png} }
\end{center}

After clicking where the bright green arrow is pointing, click the
bright green button that says \textbf{New pull request}.

In conclusion, the workflow will be as so:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  You are given an assignment.
\item
  Create a new branch.
\item
  Do you work as described above. Do the normal push and pull and
  committing.
\item
  Once you are done with your assignment, submit a \textbf{new pull
  request}.
\item
  Have a friend confirm the pull request. If there are no conflicts,
  confirm your own pull request.
\end{enumerate}

Many things can break when working with Gradescope. There are some key
issues that are bound to happen when working with Gradesope:

\hypertarget{figuring-out-filepaths}{%
\subsection{Figuring out Filepaths}\label{figuring-out-filepaths}}

\textbf{run\_autograder} relies heavily on using file paths. A good way
to test if new filepaths work is in the terminal for Macs, and GitBash
for PCs. Test the filepaths work locally before attempting to add them
to \textbf{run\_autograder}.

\hypertarget{choosing-the-version-of-r}{%
\subsection{Choosing the version of R}\label{choosing-the-version-of-r}}

Ubuntu 18.04 will by default install R.3.4.4. If your class requires a
more advanced version of R, you will have to call it in the
\textbf{setup.sh} file. Figuring out the syntax for this file is very
difficult without a background in computer science. The best way to
learn is through a virtual machine (VM) on your own computer. A useful
way to do this is with \href{https://multipass.run/}{Instant Ubuntu's
VMs}. This program will allow you to create instant VMs similar to the
one used by Gradescope. They also have helpful
\href{https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/virtualization-multipass}{resources}
for commands. This environment will allow you to troubleshoot
\textbf{setup.sh} syntax. The best part about this is that VMs are
independent of the rest of the computer: whatever you do in the VM won't
affect anything out of the VM!

\hypertarget{when-the-autograder-breaks}{%
\subsection{When the Autograder
Breaks}\label{when-the-autograder-breaks}}

This is bound to happen. You upload the autograder and find out there's
a mistake. Bummer! Because we're working through Github, all you have to
do is edit your autograder and push it to Github. This is possible
because the Gradescope virtual machine pulls the autograde\_PSExample.R
from github every time.

Common fixes to the autograder not working on Gradescope:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Set the autograder\_.r to ``gradescope''.
\item
  Push the autograder to the github.
\end{itemize}

When in doubt, ask a fellow TA or a friend.

A useful resource is Michael Guerzhoy
\href{https://github.com/guerzh/r_autograde_gradescope}{github}. He
creates autograders for functions in R. Gradescope also has a list of
useful links
\href{https://gradescope-autograders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources/}{here}.

\hypertarget{writing-questions}{%
\subsection{Writing Questions}\label{writing-questions}}

Because the autograder requires very specific inputs, it is very easy to
write questions that are not condusive to grading code. These questions
include too many parts or unclear objectives. Below is a fake assignment
with poorly written questions for autograding code. This manual will go
through each question, identify issues and provide suggestions to
improve the question:

\begin{center}
\includepdf[pages=-,pagecommand={}, width=6in, frame=TRUE]{pictures/practice-assignment.pdf}
\end{center}

\hypertarget{problem-1}{%
\subsubsection{Problem 1}\label{problem-1}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Notice that the students aren't told what to name their columns. This
  can lead to issues with reading the dataframe.
\item
  The students aren't told if the dataframe should go up and down or
  left to right. The lack of clarity on the dimensionality can lead to
  issues.
\item
  \textbf{Potential Solution}: Specify the number of columns and rows
  (if dataframes same) as well as the name of the columns.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{problem-2}{%
\subsubsection{Problem 2}\label{problem-2}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  There are multiple parts to the question.
\item
  Each part isn't clearly labeled. The student's don't know what to name
  the outcome of every problem.
\item
  \textbf{Potential Solution}: Rewrite the question with subparts and
  clearly indicate what each part should be titled.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{problem-3}{%
\subsubsection{Problem 3}\label{problem-3}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  No issues. This is a very good problem for an autograder.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{problem-4}{%
\subsubsection{Problem 4}\label{problem-4}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Same as problems 1 and 2.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{problem-5}{%
\subsubsection{Problem 5}\label{problem-5}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Is the answer the function or the results for \emph{Jordyn Kang}? It
  is unclear from the writing. What should they label the output with
  \emph{Jordyn Kang}?
\item
  \textbf{Potential Solution}: Break the problem into two parts: one
  where they write the function and one where they save the answer for
  \emph{Jordyn Kang} as jordyn\_kang.
\end{itemize}
