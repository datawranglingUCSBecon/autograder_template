This folder is meant for all the manuals needed to run Econ 145.

Econ 145 relies on multiple programs:

1) Gauchospace

2) Gradescope

3) Nectir

4) Virtual Machine

5) Qualtrics

Using all the programs can get confusing. To alleviate this, we have created manuals for both students and TAs. Manual titles that end in _ta are meant for TAs/faculty information. Manuals that end in _s are meant for students. These manuals will be posted onto the Gauchospace page.

Note to self: I don't think we need writeup_manual anymore
