# Basics

Save the class roster here as a `.csv`. Don't change any of the column names!!!

As before, follow the naming convention `year_quarter_roster`. For example, if it is fall quarter 2020, name the roster `2020_f_roster.csv`

# What's being used

The scripts rely on four columns from the roster. Below is the name exactly extracted from Gauchospace with a brief description:

1) "First name" - Student's first name.

2) "Last name" - Student's last name.

3) "Email address" - Student's school issued email address.

4) "ID number" - Student's unique school identification number

The first two are meant for pleasantries. 3) is used for the automatic email system. 4) is used the unique datasets. 4) is the most important.

If you aren't downloading from gauchospace, you can either 1) change the four column names in your dataset to match the four column names above or 2) change the R files. I recommend 1).
